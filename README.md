# Diabetes-Classification
 This project relies on training and evaluating a classification model to predict which hospitalized diabetes patients will be readmitted for their conditions at a later date. To achieve this purpose, we used a dataset that contains records of diabetes patients admitted to US hospitals. Readmission of patients is both a metric of potential poor care as well as a financial burden to patients, insurers, governments and health care providers.
